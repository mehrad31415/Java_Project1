# Java--Project1

#### A Java program that:

1. Presents a menu of choices to the user.
2. The first menu choice allows the user to enter the characters filling a 3 by 3 character array.
3. The second menu choice allows the user to display the 3 by 3 character array.
4. The third menu choice allows the user to see a count of the number of legal words present. A
legal word is formed by taking the characters of an individual column in the 3 by 3 character
array and adding the characters together in row order.
a. The Java program should define a String array of legal words.
b. The maximum number of legal words detected is 3 as there are only 3 columns.
c. Each word comprises three characters.
5. The fourth menu choice allows the user to see a count of the number of legal words (as defined
above) which are also palindromes.
a. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
6. The fifth menu choice allows the user to see a count of the number of anagrams present in an
array (created using the first menu choice) which has three legal words (as defined above).
a. An anagram is a rearrangement of the characters in a word and the rearrangement is
also a legal word.
7. The final menu choice should allow the user to quit the program.
8. Aside from the final menu choice, each other menu choice should invoke a method.
