# Java--Project1

#### A Java program that:

1. Presents a menu of choices to the user.
2. The first menu choice allows the user to enter the characters filling a 3 by 3 character array.
3. The second menu choice allows the user to display the 3 by 3 character array.
4. The third menu choice allows the user to see a count of the number of legal words present. A
legal word is formed by taking the characters of an individual column in the 3 by 3 character
array and adding the characters together in row order.
a. The Java program should define a String array of legal words.
b. The maximum number of legal words detected is 3 as there are only 3 columns.
c. Each word comprises three characters.
5. The fourth menu choice allows the user to see a count of the number of legal words (as defined
above) which are also palindromes.
a. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
6. The fifth menu choice allows the user to see a count of the number of anagrams present in an
array (created using the first menu choice) which has three legal words (as defined above).
a. An anagram is a rearrangement of the characters in a word and the rearrangement is
also a legal word.
7. The final menu choice should allow the user to quit the program.
8. Aside from the final menu choice, each other menu choice should invoke a method.

Further works on this project can be to create a game of scramble words where the user is allowed to change the location of two adjacent words.
The goal will be to end in one state where the board consists of an anagram. (obviously the board should require at least one solution)
